# nlp-risk-analyzer

An extensible, NLP-powered risk analysis toolkit and service. This repository is intended as a foundation for building pipelines that ingest unstructured text (e.g., policies, tickets, reports), identify risk signals, and produce structured outputs for dashboards or downstream automations.

## Features

- Ingest and preprocess unstructured text
- Apply configurable NLP risk heuristics and model-based scoring
- Emit structured findings for storage, alerts, or workflows
- Designed to support both local and hosted model backends

## Quickstart

1) Clone the repository
2) Create your environment file
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in values (see comments inside `.env.example`)
3) Install dependencies and run your app/CLI (implementation pending)

## Schedulers and workers

You can run either a lightweight scheduler (APScheduler) or a Celery worker for ingestion and NLP processing.

Requirements (env):

- `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/dbname`)
- Optional `NEWSAPI_KEY` to enable NewsAPI ingestion
- For Celery: `REDIS_URL` (default `redis://localhost:6379/0`)

APScheduler (every 5 minutes):

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.workers.scheduler
```

Celery worker (blueprint using Redis):

```bash
cd backend
celery -A app.workers.tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
# Optionally, you can schedule tasks externally (e.g., with celery beat or a cron):
# celery -A app.workers.tasks.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
# And trigger tasks manually:
# python -c "from app.workers.tasks import task_ingest, task_process_unprocessed; task_ingest.delay(); task_process_unprocessed.delay()"
```

What the jobs do:

- Ingestion: fetches finance headlines from RSS (and NewsAPI if configured), deduplicates, and stores in `headlines`.
- Processing: finds headlines without `mentions` and `risk_scores`, runs NLP to create `mentions` and `risk_scores`.

## Usage

This README describes the repository skeleton. Add your application code (API/CLI, pipelines, notebooks) under appropriate directories (e.g., `src/`, `api/`, or `notebooks/`).

Common workflows you may add next:

- Build a Python package under `src/` and expose a CLI
- Add a web service (FastAPI/Flask/Express) that scores documents
- Add notebooks for experimentation in `notebooks/`

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for suggested variables and comments. Replace or extend as needed based on your deployment and providers.
