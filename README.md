## nlp-risk-analyzer

An extensible, NLP-powered risk analysis toolkit and service. This repository is intended as a foundation for building pipelines that ingest unstructured text (e.g., policies, tickets, reports), identify risk signals, and produce structured outputs for dashboards or downstream automations.

### Features
- Ingest and preprocess unstructured text
- Apply configurable NLP risk heuristics and model-based scoring
- Emit structured findings for storage, alerts, or workflows
- Designed to support both local and hosted model backends

### Quickstart
1) Clone the repository
2) Create your environment file
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in values (see comments inside `.env.example`)
3) Install dependencies and run your app/CLI (implementation pending)

### Usage
This README describes the repository skeleton. Add your application code (API/CLI, pipelines, notebooks) under appropriate directories (e.g., `src/`, `api/`, or `notebooks/`).

Common workflows you may add next:
- Build a Python package under `src/` and expose a CLI
- Add a web service (FastAPI/Flask/Express) that scores documents
- Add notebooks for experimentation in `notebooks/`

### Environment variables
See `.env.example` for suggested variables and comments. Replace or extend as needed based on your deployment and providers.
